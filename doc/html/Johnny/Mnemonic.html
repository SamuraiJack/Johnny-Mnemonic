<p>Johnny.Mnemonic - Yet another "ajax back button" implementation, written on Joose3, with the test suite and no required page markup at this time</p>

<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>    var mnemonic = new Johnny.Mnemonic({
        defaultToken    : '/',
        hashFrom        : 'window'
    })

    mnemonic.on('statechange', function (mnemonic, token) {

        this.syncState(token)
    })

    mnemonic.setup()

    -or-

    var mnemonic = new Johnny.Mnemonic({
        defaultToken : '/'
    })

    mnemonic.setup(function () {

        ...

        mnemonic.on('statechange', function (mnemonic, token) {
            this.syncState(token)
        })
    })

    -later-

    mnemonic.remember(stateToken)

    mnemonic.back()
    mnemonic.forward()
</code></pre>

<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Johnny.Mnemonic is a yet another "ajax back button" implementation, with the focus on maintainability. </p>

<p>Its source code is relatively clean, and, (the most important) it has an automated test suite - this makes it different from others solutions in this area.</p>

<p>Another difference is that Mnemonic do not requires any additional page markup or assets - its a pure javascript solution. </p>

<p>Currently works on everything except Opera (patches welcome).</p>

<h1 id="implementationdetails">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</h1>

<p>Mnemonic can remember arbitrary state tokens (strings), inserting them in the browser's history along the way.
Tokens are inserted in the hash part of current URL (after the <code>#</code> sign).</p>

<p>When user will press 'back/forward' button in the browser, mnemonic will "recall" in what state the application was at that step, and notify your application 
via its <code>statechange</code> event, on which you should listen. You then can synchronize the application state in the event handler.</p>

<p>About events: Johnny.Mnemonic is a subclass of Ext.util.Observable, please refer to its documentation (see below) for details.   </p>

<h1 id="properties">PROPERTIES</h1>

<ul>
<li><code>defaultToken</code></li>
</ul>

<p>As a special case, the empty hash value is always treated as "default token" and the very initial state of the application. </p>

<p>Note: You don't need to call the <code>remember</code> method with the initial state - instead, supply it with this property.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>hashFrom</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The string, referencing the target window, which <code>location</code> object mnemonic should examine. Can be either <code>'window'</code> or <code>'top'</code>. Default value is <code>'top'</code>, what should enable
the usage from iframes.</p>

<h1 id="methods">METHODS</h1>

<ul>
<li><code>setup([readyFunc], [readyScope])</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Should be called once to initialize the mnemonic instance. Accept the optional callback and its scope, which will be called after the initialization completion.</p>

<p>This callback is the last place to subscribe on the <code>statechange</code> event - immediately after it, will be fired the 1st event, with the initial state of the application.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>remember(token)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Saves the passed <code>token</code> in the browser's history, making its available for 'back/forward' buttons. Also displays the token in the hash part of URL.</p>

<p>Note: To avoid creation of extra history step, the hash will not be modified for the initial state, when application was loaded with empty hash.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>back()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Equivalent of pressing "back" button in browser. Will switch the history on one step back and fire the <code>statechange</code> event with the according token.
You can also call the <code>back</code> method of <code>history</code> object directly.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>forward()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Equivalent of pressing "forward" button in browser. Will switch the history on one step forward and fire the <code>statechange</code> event with the according token.
You can also call the <code>forward</code> method of <code>history</code> object directly.</p>

<h1 id="events">EVENTS</h1>

<ul>
<li><code>statechange(mnemonic, token)</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Will be fired with 2 parameters above. Application should listen on this event and synchronize its state according to received state token.</p>

<p>Note: This event will be also fired for the initial state of the application. So, generally, you shouldn't treat the initial state specially, just
define a correct synchronization handler. </p>

<p>The last place to subscribe on this event is the callback passed to <code>setup</code>. Immediately after that callback execution, will be fired the event with the initial state.  </p>

<h1 id="bugs">BUGS</h1>

<p>Currently, test suite can't be ran under Chrome - seems it doesn't allow manipulations with window's history from another window.
While pressing the 'back/forward' buttons manually, it works fine though.</p>

<p>All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception.</p>
